NOTE: This should not be confused with updating the version of the codename one dependencies in your application project.  To update the version of codename one that your project uses, you should open the `pom.xml` of the root module, and set the `<cn1.version>` property to the https://search.maven.org/artifact/com.codenameone/codenameone-maven-plugin[latest version of Codename One available on Maven central].
